# Cygnus on Starknet!

This is the V2 of [Cygnus on Starknet](https://github.com/CygnusDAO/cygnus-starknet) using latest Scarb edition.

It introduces a few improvements, such us using [ERC6909](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6909) to allow users depositing concentrated liquidity positions instead of relying on V2/ALM's to manage their liquidity.

It also simplifies the contracts a lot, making the contracts less upgradable.
